# Hookbloom new year clock (TM)
In this project Hookbloom presents a new year clock! Running this script will semi accuratly tell you how many seconds there are until a new year occurs. In future updates we aim to let you know which year you're actually counting down to. For now, you might be able to detect this from the code.

# Coding standard
Hookbloom has applied a code style that we feel is applicable for the complicatedness of this application. Each year we aim to add to the complexity of the code base, presenting new features and supporting counting down to a different year.
